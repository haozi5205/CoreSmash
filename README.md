### == What is Core Smash? ==
CoreSmash is a challenging bubble shooter/match3 game written in Java and built around the Libgdx framework. It is a personal project that I started while I was learning Java in order to get hands-on experience in the development of Java applications. In this repository you can find the full source code for the project without the assets.


### == Platforms ==
With the help of Libgdx the project is currently able to run on Desktops and Android devices.
